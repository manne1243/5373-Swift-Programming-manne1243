# Indoor and outdoor methods of tracking users via mobile phones.
# Abstract

Tracking a user’s location and behavior through his mobile device can be achieved in
several different ways such as GPS, WIFI, and RFID. This paper will discuss about a 
mobile tracking application called “TrackMeApp” which keeps track of a person and give 
his information of location at current point when needed. This application is mainly used 
for the child tracking along with a unique safety zone alert feature. This paper will also 
discuss about an indoor environment application “location-tracking” which can be used 
in every daily life to track your co-workers or friends within the closed/on campus 
environment, etc. This application runs using the inbuilt information already present in 
his/her mobile device. Various algorithms on how to get a Real Time location of a 
person using the Wi-Fi signals and a mobile device in a closed areas will be discussed 
in this paper. Use of the RFID technology and its various applications used for 
controlling the building access, livestock tracking is emphasized. Role of GPS in the current environment in terms of care, convenience and control with providing privacy and accuracy in location based services is examined in this paper.
